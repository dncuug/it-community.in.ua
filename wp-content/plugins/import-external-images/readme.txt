== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does this plugin work? =

The plugin examines the HTML source of your post when you save it, inspecting each IMG tag, and processing them according to the options you have selected.  

Under the default settings, it will find IMG tags with links to images on other web sites and copy those images to your web site, updating the IMG src to point to your copy.

= Does it work with MultiSite? =

Yes! It was developed and built ( and is used everyday ) at PhotographyBlogSites.com - a multisite install.

= What if i don't want to import images from a third party image hosting site? =

You can make it ignore any domain you want on the settings page, in case you work with a CDN or photo hosting site and want to keep those images where they are.
